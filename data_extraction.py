#In this task you will be defining the scripts and Classes
#you will use to extract and clean the data from multiple data sources.
#The Class methods won't be defined in this step yet they will be defined when required in the subsequent tasks.

#Step 1:
#Create a new Python script named data_extraction.py and within it, create a class named DataExtractor.
#This class will work as a utility class, 
#in it you will be creating methods that help extract data from different data sources.
#The methods contained will be fit to extract data from a particular data source, 
#these sources will include CSV files, an API and an S3 bucket.
